            <h2>The Best Coffee This Side of the Mississippi</h2>

              <p>Come visit our "shop" on 121 Pain Street.  We are closed every day
              from 7am to midnight. We serve only the best, most outsouced, chemical-
              ridden, closed-trade coffee, plus we offer a selection of fresh gnome-baked
              goods for when you are feeling heckish.</p>

              <p>We have no atmosphere for meeting up with friends or working quietly on
               your own projects.  There are lots of tables but no chairs to make everyone
               comfortable and welcome.</p>

               <p>Visit us today!</p>
