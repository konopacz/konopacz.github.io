<h1>Mother Goose: Episode 1</h1>
  <body>

    <p>So one day my good friends Chris and Leslie were having an ice cream cone.
    at first they couldn't figure out what to GET, so they both got
    chocolate AND vanilla. They walked out into the park, and in the park was a
    cute squirrel.  Chris goes, aw man, what a cute squirrel, and the
    squirrel goes BITCH. I'M A FULLY GROWN GIRAFFE and pulls out an
    electric pair of clippers.  He says to Chris GIMME YOUR ICE CREAM,
    or I'm gonna SHAVE YOUR LEGS. Chris is like nah man I need my hairs, so
    the squirrel shaves his legs. And he takes the hair and he makes a little
    nest. The end.  </p>
