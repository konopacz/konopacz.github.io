      <h3>XKCD Review (post #1)</h3>
<fig> <img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/angular_momentum.jpg"></fig>
       <p>XKCD is a long running, extremely successful webcomic written and drawn by Randall Munroe. It describes itself as “A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language,” and it explores these topics with dry humor, irony, and a whimsical view of the world around us.  The drawings are completely drawn in black and white, and most opt for very simple linework and stick figure depictions of humans.  A few characters recur, but most just represent larger character archetypes.  The XKCD website is the quintessential webcomic site.  It features a clear and understandable website layout with a clear navigation bar, an obvious content portion, and lots of relevant links.  Upon visiting the site, the main attraction is rightfully the strip- it occupies the main section of the page.  The most recent strip fills the majority of this primary space, and above and below the strip are buttons to easily navigate to other strips that have been posted, in chronological order.  Also in this section are links for easy sharing.  The top left of the screen has an extremely clear navigation section, with obvious strip-related links such as the blog and the store.  The bottom of the page is full of links to certain special comics within thumbnails, comics that Randall recommends, and finally, his copyright license.
	</p><p>Overall, this page is extremely effective at accomplishing the basic goals of a webcomic site.  The reader is naturally drawn the the content, and can easily view more.  If the visitor wishes to navigate to any other possible attractions, everything is laid out clearly and obviously.  Though the simplicity of the site does make it timeless to a degree, it is certainly a bit bland in its overall visual aesthetic.  However, this could also be attributed to the fact that the aesthetic of the comic is also very simple, and brevity and clarity are the elements holding the site together with its’ content.  If it were up to me as a designer, I would certainly implement some more interesting color and visual hierarchy choices.
	</p><p>XKCD is an excellent comic I’d recommend to anyone with an interest in comics, science, or a unique worldview.  It has a website that serves it well, and despite its’ age I have no doubt XKCD will continue for many more years.
